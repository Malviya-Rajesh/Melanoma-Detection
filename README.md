# Melanoma Detection: A Deep Learning Approach to Skin Cancer Classification

> This project focuses on utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect melanoma, a highly dangerous form of skin cancer. By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN), this project aims to classify 10 different types of skin lesions, assisting in early and accurate diagnosis of melanoma.

## General Information
- **Background**: Melanoma is a critical public health issue due to its high mortality rate when not detected early. This project aims to build a deep learning-based image classification model that can automatically detect melanoma, aiding dermatologists in providing quicker and more accurate diagnoses.
  
- **Business Problem**: In clinical practice, skin lesion examination can be subjective and time-consuming. Automating the detection process can reduce diagnostic errors, increase the accuracy of early-stage melanoma detection, and ultimately save lives.

- **Objective**: To develop a model capable of classifying dermoscopic images of skin lesions into 10 distinct classes, including melanoma, using deep learning.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset used in this project is derived from the [ISIC Archive](https://www.isic-archive.com/) and the [Kaggle SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification).
  
- **Description**: The dataset contains thousands of labeled dermoscopic images representing 10 skin lesion types, including benign and malignant skin cancers. Melanoma is the most critical class, representing the deadliest form of skin cancer.
  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - **Image Normalization**: All images were scaled to the range [0, 1] by dividing pixel values by 255.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as random rotations, zooming, flipping, and shifting were applied to artificially increase the variability in the dataset, improving model generalization.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow** - version 2.x (Deep Learning Framework)
- **Keras** - version 2.x (High-level API for TensorFlow)
- **Python** - version 3.8+ (Programming Language)
- **Matplotlib** - version 3.x (Visualization)
- **Pandas** - version 1.x (Data Manipulation and Analysis)
- **NumPy** - version 1.x (Numerical Operations)
- **scikit-learn** - version 0.24.x (Data Preprocessing and Evaluation Metrics)

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
  - Input layer with image dimensions (128, 128, 3) for dermoscopic images.
  - Two convolutional blocks, each containing Conv2D, BatchNormalization, MaxPooling, and Dropout layers.
  - Fully connected layer with 128 units and a final softmax output layer with 10 classes.
  
- **Regularization**:
  - L2 regularization was applied to dense layers to reduce overfitting.
  - Dropout layers with increasing drop rates (0.3 to 0.5) were used to improve generalization.
  
- **Optimization**:
  - Adam optimizer was used with a learning rate scheduler.
  - Early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting based on validation loss.

## Results and Conclusions
- **Model Performance**: The final model achieved high accuracy on the validation dataset, with an F1-score indicating robust performance across all 10 skin cancer classes.
  
- **Conclusions**:
  - **Conclusion 1**: The CNN model significantly improved accuracy compared to traditional diagnostic methods, showing potential for clinical applications.
  - **Conclusion 2**: Data augmentation and early stopping played a crucial role in mitigating overfitting, which is common in medical image classification tasks.
  - **Conclusion 3**: The combination of image preprocessing techniques and deep learning led to a more accurate model with better generalization on unseen data.
  - **Conclusion 4**: The trained model can serve as an assistive diagnostic tool, potentially reducing human error in the early detection of melanoma.
